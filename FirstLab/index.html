            <h2> Is there a Link between church noise and Joy?</h2>

            <p id = "first-paragraph"> Some people confuse Church Noise to people crying out of sorrows, 
                fear. Although it is true that some people are crying outloud due to 
                the mentioned reasons, Some are just crying out their thanks and worshiping 
                out of Love and research has found that these people do feel happy, contented
                and they find joy and pleasure in crying out to God. Some do even say there 
                is joy and pleasure in crying outloud their problems to God because they feel 
                and believe that they will get answers to their prayers.
