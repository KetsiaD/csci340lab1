        <p> Some people confuse Church Noise to people crying out of sorrows, 
            fear. Although it is true that some people are crying outloud due to 
            the mentioned reasons, Some are just crying out their thanks and worshiping 
            out of Love and research has found that these people do feel happy, contented
             and they find joy and pleasure in crying out to God. Some do even say there 
             is joy and pleasure in crying outloud their problems to God because they feel 
             and believe that they will get answers to their prayers.
